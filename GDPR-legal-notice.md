# Prerequisites

- This statements only apply to the EDR hosted at https://edr.simrail.fr/ or https://edr.deadlykungfu.ninja/ I cannot guarantee anything for modified versions of the EDR or self hosted versions.
- SimrailFR is not a professional organisation, it is a community that aims to unity all the french speaking community playing simrail.
- On the developpement side, we are not an organised crew, we are a bunch of solo developpers helping each orthers on each orther projects.
- We are professionnal and hobbyist developpers giving their free time to develop software for a game that we like, SimRail.

Please understand that the EDR is not made centralized in order to make me money, in fact it cost me money but this is a way so everyone can enjoy the software.
